#subtitle: Building ties with our fraternal socialist parties.

At the <span style="color: #D50032;">Labor and Socialist International</span>, we can forge contacts with our fraternal <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> parties in <span style="color: #001489;">Europe</span> and across the world.

- @fr_uk: Build relationships with the <span style="color: #002654;">French</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">SFIO</span> and <span style="color: #C8102E;">British</span> <span style="color: #f0456a;">Labour Party</span> to move their governments in Germany's favor.
- @poland: Let's contact the <span style="color: #DC143C;">Polish soc</span><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">ialist party</span>, the democratic opposition against the <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> dictatorship.
- @austria: Learn organization and street fighting from the <span style="color: #EF3340;">Au</span><span style="color: #ffffff;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">str</span></span><span style="color: #EF3340;">ian</span> <span style="color: #A50034;">SDAPÃ–</span>.
- @scandi: Learn the path of economics and reform from the Scandinavian <span style="color: #D70926;">social democrats</span>.
- @comintern: Forget the second international - embed a spy in the <span style="color: #D50000;">Comintern</span>'s conference.
- @america: Contact the <span style="color: #940f0f;">Socialist Party of America</span>.
- @return: We do not need international contacts at the moment.

The <span style="color: #f0456a;">socialists</span> of <span style="color: #002654;">France</span> and <span style="color: #C8102E;">Britain</span> can influence their governments to be friendlier towards Germany. Hopefully they will reduce our reparations burden.

We send some funds to the <span style="color: #DC143C;">PPS</span>, allowing us to have a higher leverage in negotiations between our countries.

Our Reichsbanner can learn much in paramilitary organization and training from the Austrian Republikanischer Schutzbund (Republican Protection Units), the paramilitary branch of the <span style="color: #EF3340;">Au</span><span style="color: #ffffff;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">str</span></span><span style="color: #EF3340;">ian</span> <span style="color: #A50034;">social democrats</span>.

[? if austrian_parliament_seen and not austrian_civil_war_seen: We are also helping the Austrian <span style="color: #A50034;">Social Democratic Worker's Party</span> build up their resources in preparation for a future struggle, legally and illegally. ?]

The programs of the Nordic <span style="color: #D70926;">socialists</span> involve active government intervention in the economy. We can learn from their economic strategies, and how they moved beyond their working-class base to attract a broader set of constituents.

The <span style="color: #8B0000;">Stalinists</span> of the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> insists on calling us "<span style="color: #c00000;">social</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>", suggesting that we <span style="color: #c00000;">social democrats</span> are as bad or worse than actual <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>. Needless to say, this is not good for our relationship with the <span style="color: #700000;">communists</span>. By observing the <span style="color: #D50000;">Comintern</span>, we can better understand the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, enabling us to potentially improve relations, or counter the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> if it may come to that.

The <span style="color: #940f0f;">Socialist Party of America</span> is tiny and has limited support. There is not much we can do for them, and conversely, not much they can do for us.

@reduce

We do not need the international contacts at the moment.
